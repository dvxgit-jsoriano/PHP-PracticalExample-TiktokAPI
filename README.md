# PHP-PracticalExample-TiktokAPI

- This is a practical example to test Tiktok API integration.
- This example assumes you already know how to clone, test and deploy your PHP web applications.
- It is required for you to read tiktok documentation first.
- Tiktok requires an https even if it is just for testing. Note that NGROK is not an option for testing because you have to submit your app for approval. It is a low chance that your ngrok https link will stay the same.

## Resources

- **Vanilla PHP** just means plain original PHP without any framework.
